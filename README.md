### Jetson Nano Builds
A variety of 3D printed mounts, adapters, and kits so you can take the NVIDIA Jetson Nano anywhere.

The Jetson Nano is a fairly power efficient RasberryPi on steroids. And having a few lying around got me thinking about all the odd places I could now take this small, portable AI-enabled computer.

- Utility Belt
- Garden Stake
- Bicycle Mount
- Car Mount

Attach the Nano to useful things like:
- Glass, with the Suction Cup Kit
- Metal, with the Magnet Kit
- Tripods, with the Tripod Leg Clips
- Extruded Aluminium, with the 8020 or Openbeam Clips

Or just tidy up your desk with a nice Nano Stand:

- Nano Stand
- Nano Stand with Battery Clip
- Nano Stand with Battery Clip and Extruded Aluminium Extensions

#### Build Settings
were tested on a [Prusa i3 MK3S](https://www.prusa3d.com/original-prusa-i3-mk3/) printer. I've included all my build settings with each model, but keep in mind that your settings and tolerances may vary based on the printer and printing method you use.
