### Jetson Nano Builds
A variety of 3D printed mounts, adapters, and kits so you can take the NVIDIA Jetson Nano anywhere.

The Jetson Nano is a fairly power efficient RasberryPi on steroids. And having a few lying around got me thinking about all the odd places I could now take this small, portable AI-enabled computer.

- Utility Belt
- Garden Stake
- Bicycle Mount
- Car Mount

Attach the Nano to useful things like:
- Glass, with the Suction Cup Kit
- Metal, with the Magnet Kit
- Tripods, with the Tripod Leg Clips
- Extruded Aluminium, with the 8020 or Openbeam Clips

Or just tidy up your desk with a nice Nano Stand:

- Nano Stand
- Nano Stand with Battery Clip
- Nano Stand with Battery Clip and Extruded Aluminium Extensions

## Modular Clip System
These assemblies use a system of clips to hold the Jetson Nano to a variety of swappable adapters and mounts. The idea behind this modular system is to allow you to use your Nano in a number of new scenarios, without needing to screw it into an enclosure. So you could snap it into the [Bicycle Mount Kit](https://github.com/madelinegannon/jetson-nano-builds/tree/master/bicycle-mount) for your commute to work, snap it into a [Stand](https://github.com/madelinegannon/jetson-nano-builds/tree/master/stands) that's sitting on your workstation, and maybe put your Nano on your [Refrigerator](https://github.com/madelinegannon/jetson-nano-builds/tree/master/magnetic-mount) or in your [Garden](https://github.com/madelinegannon/jetson-nano-builds/tree/master/garden-stake) when you get back home.

#### Build Settings
Each of included models were printed on a [Prusa i3 MK3S](https://www.prusa3d.com/original-prusa-i3-mk3/) printer. All my build settings are detail in the instructions for each assembly, but keep in mind that your settings and tolerances may vary based on the printer and printing method you use.
