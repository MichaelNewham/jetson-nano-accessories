### Jetson Nano Builds
A variety of mounts, adapters, and rigs to take the NVIDIA Jetson Nano anywhere.

The Jetson Nano is a fairly power efficient RasberryPi on steroid. It got me thinking about all the odd places I could now take this small, portable AI-enabled computer.

#### Build Settings
were tested on a [Prusa i3 MK3S](https://www.prusa3d.com/original-prusa-i3-mk3/) printer. I've included all my build settings with each model, but keep in mind that your settings and tolerances may vary based on the printer and printing method you use.
