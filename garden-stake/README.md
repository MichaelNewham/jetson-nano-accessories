### Jetson Nano Garden Stake
The Jetson Nano is lightweight and power-efficient, which means you can easily take it outdoors. This Garden Stake assembly has a place to clip in a Jetson Nano developer kit and a portable battery pack, and to add cameras and other peripherals. The pointy stake is great for holding the Nano in soft ground.

Here's a few project ideas to get started:
- Detect and report on bugs and pests in your garden.
- Detect poorly irrigated parts of your lawn.
- Take it to the beach to monitor your sun exposure.
- Use it to drive your outdoor projection mapping projects.

> The Jetson Nano is not waterproof, so use on a sunny day :)

## Assembly Instructions

1. Print the [jetson_nano_outdoors_stake.stl](https://github.com/madelinegannon/jetson-nano-builds/blob/master/garden-stake/jetson_nano_outdoors_stake.stl) at 10% infill.
2. Print the [jetson_nano_outdoors_stake_board.stl](https://github.com/madelinegannon/jetson-nano-builds/blob/master/garden-stake/jetson_nano_outdoors_stake_board.stl) and two [jetson_nano_clip.stl](https://github.com/madelinegannon/jetson-nano-builds/blob/master/garden-stake/jetson_nano_clip.stl) at 20% infill.
3. Slide the two Jetson Nano Clips into the front of the printed board (this should be a tight fiction fit). 
    - _Note: The front of the board has centered slots and a rougher finish._
4. Snap your Jetson Nano into the Clips â€” you should hear a nice click sound.
5. Slide the two Battery Clips into the back of the printed board (this should be a tight fiction fit). 
    - _Note: The back of the board has off-centered slots and a smoother finish._
6. Snap your Portable Battery into the Battery Clips, and plug in the Nano and other peripherals.
7. Bolt the board to the stake using the M3 screws and washers.
8. Stick into the ground and go.

#### Printer Settings
Each of these parts were printed on a [Prusa i3 MK3S](https://www.prusa3d.com/original-prusa-i3-mk3/) printer using the MK3S_MK3_0.2_Fast profile (0.2mm layer height) with PLA.
