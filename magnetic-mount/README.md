## Assembly Instructions

1. Print the [jetson_nano_board_magnet.stl](https://github.com/madelinegannon/jetson-nano-builds/blob/master/magnetic-mount/jetson_nano_board_magnet.stl),  two [jetson_nano_clip_magnet.stl](https://github.com/madelinegannon/jetson-nano-builds/blob/master/magnetic-mount/jetson_nano_clip_magnet.stl), two [jetson_nano_clip.stl](https://github.com/madelinegannon/jetson-nano-builds/blob/master/garden-stake/jetson_nano_clip.stl), and two [jetson_nano_clip_battery.stl](https://github.com/madelinegannon/jetson-nano-builds/blob/master/magnetic-mount/jetson_nano_clip_battery.stl) at 20% infill.
2. Attach the Magnet Clips to the printed boards.
    - Begin by pushing two M3 nuts into the hexagonal holes inside each of the Magent Clips.
    - Screw each of the Magent Clips to the back of the printed board using two M3x8 screws.
    - Push in a Disc Magent into the bottom of each Magnet Clip (this should be a tight fiction fit and snap into place).
        - The Magnet Clips _should_ hold each Disc Magnet in place with friction alone — add glue if the fit is too loose.
3. Slide the two Jetson Nano Clips into the front of the printed board (this should be a tight fiction fit). 
    - _Note: The front of the board has centered slots and a rougher finish._
4. Snap your Jetson Nano into the Clips — you should hear a nice click sound.
5. Slide the two Battery Clips into the back of the printed board (this should be a tight fiction fit). 
    - _Note: The back of the board has off-centered slots and a smoother finish._
6. Snap your Portable Battery into the Battery Clips, and plug in the Nano and other peripherals.
7. Stick onto a metal surface and go!

#### Printer Settings
Each of these parts were printed on a [Prusa i3 MK3S](https://www.prusa3d.com/original-prusa-i3-mk3/) printer using the MK3S_MK3_0.2_Fast profile (0.2mm layer height) with PLA.
