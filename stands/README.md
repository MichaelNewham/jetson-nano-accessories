## Assembly Instructions

1. Print your desired Stand at 20% infill.
2. Orient your Nano vertically and snap your Jetson Nano into the front the Stand — you should hear a nice click sound.
3. If you're adding a Portable Battery, orient your battery horizontally and snap the battery into the back of the Stand — you should hear a nice click sound.

#### Printer Settings
Each of these parts were printed on a [Prusa i3 MK3S](https://www.prusa3d.com/original-prusa-i3-mk3/) printer using the MK3S_MK3_0.2_Fast profile (0.2mm layer height) with PLA.
