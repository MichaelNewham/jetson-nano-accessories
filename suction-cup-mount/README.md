### Jetson Nano Suction Cup Mount
This Suction Cup Mount Kit adds suction cups to the back of your Jetson Nano, so you can stick it in hard-to-reach or moving surfaces. The suction cups work best on clean, smooth surfaces, such as glass or acrylic.

Here's a few project ideas to get started:
- Mount inside your car, and use the Nano to create a DIY head's up display
- Mount to a window, and use the Nano as a motion detector
- Mount to a dry-erase board, and use the Nano for real-time sketch recognition

## Assembly Instructions

1. Print the [jetson_nano_board.stl](https://github.com/madelinegannon/jetson-nano-builds/blob/master/suction-cup-mount/jetson_nano_board.stl), two [jetson_nano_clip.stl](https://github.com/madelinegannon/jetson-nano-builds/blob/master/suction-cup-mount/jetson_nano_clip.stl), and four [jetson_nano_clips_tripod.stl]([jetson_nano_clips_suction-cup.stl](https://github.com/madelinegannon/jetson-nano-builds/blob/master/suction-cup-mount/jetson_nano_clip_suction-cup.stl) at 20% infill.
2. Slide the two Jetson Nano Clips into the front of the printed board (this should be a tight fiction fit). 
    - _Note: The front of the board has centered slots and a rougher finish._
3. Snap your Jetson Nano into the Clips â€” you should hear a nice click sound.
4. Slide a 30mm suction cup into each of the Suction Cup Clips (this should be a tight fiction fit). 
5. Slide each of the Suction Cup Clips into the back of the printed board (this should be a tight fiction fit). 
    - _Note: The back of the board has off-centered slots and a smoother finish._
6. Thoroughly clean the surface you'll be suctioning to, and then give the assembly a good press down onto the surface.
   - These suction cups work best on completely smooth surfaces, such as glass. 
7. Stick it and go!

#### Printer Settings
Each of these parts were printed on a [Prusa i3 MK3S](https://www.prusa3d.com/original-prusa-i3-mk3/) printer using the MK3S_MK3_0.2_Fast profile (0.2mm layer height) with PLA.
