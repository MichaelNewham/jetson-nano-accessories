### Jetson Nano Suction Cup Mount
This Suction Cup Mount assembly uses suction cups to keep your Jetson Nano in place while driving. 
**FIX THIS**
Plug the Nano into your car's 12V auxiliary power (the cigarette lighter) to power the board.

Here's a few project ideas to get started:
- Detect bored passengers in the backseat, and entertain them
- Create a DIY head's up display
- Monitor interior car temperature

## Assembly Instructions

1. Print the [jetson_nano_board.stl](https://github.com/madelinegannon/jetson-nano-builds/blob/master/suction-cup-mount/jetson_nano_board.stl), two [jetson_nano_clip.stl](https://github.com/madelinegannon/jetson-nano-builds/blob/master/suction-cup-mount/jetson_nano_clip.stl), and four [jetson_nano_clips_tripod.stl]([jetson_nano_clips_suction-cup.stl](https://github.com/madelinegannon/jetson-nano-builds/blob/master/suction-cup-mount/jetson_nano_clip_suction-cup.stl) at 20% infill.
2. Slide the two Jetson Nano Clips into the front of the printed board (this should be a tight fiction fit). 
    - _Note: The front of the board has centered slots and a rougher finish._
3. Snap your Jetson Nano into the Clips â€” you should hear a nice click sound.
4. Slide a 30mm suction cup into each of the Suction Cup Clips (this should be a tight fiction fit). 
5. Slide each of the Suction Cup Clips into the back of the printed board (this should be a tight fiction fit). 
    - _Note: The back of the board has off-centered slots and a smoother finish._
6. Thoroughly clean the surface you'll be suctioning to, and then give the assembly a good press down onto the surface.
   - These suction cups work best on completely smooth surfaces, such as glass. 
7. Plug in your USB Car Adapter into the 12V auxilary port, and then plug in the Nano and other peripherals.
8. Start your engine and go!

#### Printer Settings
Each of these parts were printed on a [Prusa i3 MK3S](https://www.prusa3d.com/original-prusa-i3-mk3/) printer using the MK3S_MK3_0.2_Fast profile (0.2mm layer height) with PLA.
