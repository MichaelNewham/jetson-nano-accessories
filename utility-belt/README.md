## Assembly Instructions

1. Print the [jetson_nano_board_buckle.stl](https://github.com/madelinegannon/jetson-nano-builds/blob/master/utility-belt/jetson_nano_board_buckle.stl), [jetson_nano_battery_buckle.stl](https://github.com/madelinegannon/jetson-nano-builds/blob/master/utility-belt/jetson_nano_battery_buckle.stl), two [jetson_nano_clip.stl](https://github.com/madelinegannon/jetson-nano-builds/blob/master/garden-utility/jetson_nano_clip.stl), and one [jetson_nano_clip_battery-vertical.stl](https://github.com/madelinegannon/jetson-nano-builds/blob/master/utility-belt/jetson_nano_clip_battery-vertical.stl) at 20% infill.
2. Slide the two Jetson Nano Clips into the front of the printed board with buckle (this should be a tight fiction fit). 
    - _Note: This board has multiple slots for clips._
3. Snap your Jetson Nano into the Clips — you should hear a nice click sound.
4. Slide the one Battery Clip (Vertical) into the back of the printed battery board with buckle (this should be a tight fiction fit). 
    - _Note: The battery board only has one slot for a clip._
5. Snap your Portable Battery into the Battery Clip, and plug in the Nano and other peripherals.
6. Attach the plastic Buckle, Glides, and Nylon Straps following these instructions: [Steps 1-6](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91%2BgqnHoY0L._SL1500_.jpg) and [Steps 7-10](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81tcsMIyBYL._SL1500_.jpg).
